License: CC-BY-SA-3.0

License: CC-BY-SA-3.0
 THE  WORK  (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE  WORK
 IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF
 THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT
 LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY  EXERCISING  ANY  RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT
 AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT
 THIS  LICENSE  MAY  BE  CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR
 GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR AC‐
 CEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
    1.  "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the
 Work and other pre‐existing works, such as a translation, adapta‐
 tion,  derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations
 of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or  performance  and
 includes  cinematographic  adaptations or any other form in which
 the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in  any
 form  recognizably  derived from the original, except that a work
 that constitutes a Collection will not be considered  an  Adapta‐
 tion for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt,
 where the Work is a musical work, performance or  phonogram,  the
 synchronization of the Work in timed‐relation with a moving image
 ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose  of
 this License.
    2.  "Collection"  means  a  collection of literary or artistic
 works, such as encyclopedias and  anthologies,  or  performances,
 phonograms  or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other
 than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of  the
 selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellec‐
 tual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety  in
 unmodified  form along with one or more other contributions, each
 constituting separate and independent works in themselves,  which
 together  are assembled into a collective whole. A work that con‐
 stitutes a Collection will not be considered  an  Adaptation  (as
 defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    3.  "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that
 is listed at  http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses  that
 has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equiv‐
 alent to this License, including, at a minimum, because that  li‐
 cense: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and
 effect as the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explic‐
 itly  permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made avail‐
 able under that license under this License or a Creative  Commons
 jurisdiction  license  with the same License Elements as this Li‐
 cense.
    4. "Distribute" means to make  available  to  the  public  the
 original  and  copies  of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate,
 through sale or other transfer of ownership.
    5. "License Elements" means the following  high‐level  license
 attributes  as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of
 this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
    6. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or en‐
 tities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
    7.  "Original  Author"  means,  in  the  case of a literary or
 artistic work, the individual, individuals,  entity  or  entities
 who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identi‐
 fied, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a perfor‐
 mance  the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons
 who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or  otherwise
 perform  literary  or  artistic works or expressions of folklore;
 (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person  or
 legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other
 sounds; and, (iii) in the case of  broadcasts,  the  organization
 that transmits the broadcast.
    8.  "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered un‐
 der the terms of this License including  without  limitation  any
 production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, what‐
 ever may be the mode or form of its expression including  digital
 form,  such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, ad‐
 dress, sermon or other work of the same  nature;  a  dramatic  or
 dramatico‐musical  work; a choreographic work or entertainment in
 dumb show; a musical composition with or without words;  a  cine‐
 matographic  work  to  which are assimilated works expressed by a
 process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
 architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic
 work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analo‐
 gous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map,
 plan, sketch or three‐dimensional work relative to geography, to‐
 pography,  architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
 phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as
 a  copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus
 performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary
 or artistic work.
    9. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under
 this License who has not previously violated the  terms  of  this
 License  with  respect  to  the Work, or who has received express
 permission from the Licensor to exercise rights  under  this  Li‐
 cense despite a previous violation.
   10.  "Publicly  Perform" means to perform public recitations of
 the Work and to communicate to the public  those  public  recita‐
 tions,  by  any  means  or process, including by wire or wireless
 means or public digital performances; to make  available  to  the
 public  Works in such a way that members of the public may access
 these Works from a place and at a place  individually  chosen  by
 them;  to  perform the Work to the public by any means or process
 and the communication to the public of the  performances  of  the
 Work,  including  by public digital performance; to broadcast and
 rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or  im‐
 ages.
   11.  "Reproduce"  means to make copies of the Work by any means
 including without limitation by sound or  visual  recordings  and
 the  right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, in‐
 cluding storage of a protected performance or phonogram in  digi‐
 tal form or other electronic medium.
 .
 2.  Fair  Dealing  Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
 reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
 arising  from  limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
 connection with the copyright protection under copyright  law  or
 other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Li‐
 cense, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty‐free, non‐
 exclusive,  perpetual  (for  the duration of the applicable copy‐
 right) license to exercise the rights in the Work as  stated  be‐
 low:
 .
    1.  to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or
 more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work  as  incorporated  in
 the Collections;
    2.  to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
 Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,  takes  rea‐
 sonable  steps  to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
 that changes were made to  the  original  Work.  For  example,  a
 translation  could  be  marked  "The original work was translated
 from English to Spanish," or a modification could  indicate  "The
 original work has been modified.";
    3.  to  Distribute  and Publicly Perform the Work including as
 incorporated in Collections; and,
    4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
    5.
 .
       For the avoidance of doubt:
          1. Non‐waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those ju‐
 risdictions  in  which the right to collect royalties through any
 statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot  be  waived,  the
 Licensor  reserves  the exclusive right to collect such royalties
 for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
          2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those  juris‐
 dictions  in  which  the  right  to collect royalties through any
 statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,  the  Li‐
 censor  waives  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for
 any exercise by You of the rights  granted  under  this  License;
 and,
          3.  Voluntary  License  Schemes. The Licensor waives the
 right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event
 that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that admin‐
 isters voluntary licensing schemes, via that  society,  from  any
 exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The  above  rights  may  be  exercised  in  all media and formats
 whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights  include
 the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary
 to exercise the rights in other media  and  formats.  Subject  to
 Section  8(f),  all  rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
 hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3  above  is  ex‐
 pressly  made  subject  to  and limited by the following restric‐
 tions:
 .
    1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only  under
 the  terms  of  this  License. You must include a copy of, or the
 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this  License  with  every
 copy  of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
 offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms  of
 this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exer‐
 cise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of  the
 License.  You  may  not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact
 all notices that refer to this License and to the  disclaimer  of
 warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
 Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform  the  Work,  You
 may  not  impose any effective technological measures on the Work
 that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You  to
 exercise  the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
 the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporat‐
 ed  in  a  Collection,  but  this does not require the Collection
 apart from the Work itself to be made subject  to  the  terms  of
 this  License.  If  You create a Collection, upon notice from any
 Licensor You must, to the extent  practicable,  remove  from  the
 Collection  any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
 If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from  any  Licensor  You
 must,  to  the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
 credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
    2. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an  Adaptation  only
 under  the  terms  of:  (i) this License; (ii) a later version of
 this License with the same  License  Elements  as  this  License;
 (iii)  a  Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a
 later license version) that contains the same License Elements as
 this  License (e.g., Attribution‐ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Cre‐
 ative Commons Compatible License. If you license  the  Adaptation
 under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with
 the terms of that license. If you license  the  Adaptation  under
 the  terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii)
 (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of the
 Applicable  License  generally  and the following provisions: (I)
 You must include a copy of, or the URI for,  the  Applicable  Li‐
 cense  with  every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Pub‐
 licly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on  the
 Adaptation  that  restrict the terms of the Applicable License or
 the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation  to  exercise  the
 rights  granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applica‐
 ble License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to
 the  Applicable  License and to the disclaimer of warranties with
 every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distrib‐
 ute  or  Publicly  Perform;  (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly
 Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective  techno‐
 logical measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a
 recipient of the Adaptation  from  You  to  exercise  the  rights
 granted  to  that recipient under the terms of the Applicable Li‐
 cense. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporat‐
 ed  in  a  Collection,  but  this does not require the Collection
 apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the  terms
 of the Applicable License.
    3.  If  You  Distribute,  or  Publicly Perform the Work or any
 Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request  has  been
 made  pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
 for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or  means  You
 are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
 if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author  and/or
 Licensor  designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor in‐
 stitute, publishing entity, journal) for  attribution  ("Attribu‐
 tion  Parties")  in Licensor’s copyright notice, terms of service
 or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or  parties;
 (ii)  the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent rea‐
 sonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies  to
 be  associated  with  the Work, unless such URI does not refer to
 the copyright notice or licensing information for the  Work;  and
 (iv)  ,  consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adapta‐
 tion, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the  Adaptation
 (e.g.,  "French  translation  of the Work by Original Author," or
 "Screenplay based on original  Work  by  Original  Author").  The
 credit  required  by  this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any
 reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adap‐
 tation  or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
 credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or  Collec‐
 tion  appears,  then  as part of these credits and in a manner at
 least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing  au‐
 thors.  For  the  avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
 required by this Section for the purpose of  attribution  in  the
 manner  set  out  above and, by exercising Your rights under this
 License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
 connection  with,  sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Au‐
 thor, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You
 or  Your  use  of  the  Work, without the separate, express prior
 written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attri‐
 bution Parties.
    4. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as
 may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if  You  Reproduce,
 Distribute  or  Publicly  Perform the Work either by itself or as
 part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mu‐
 tilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the
 Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author’s honor or
 reputation.  Licensor  agrees  that  in those jurisdictions (e.g.
 Japan), in which any exercise of the  right  granted  in  Section
 3(b)  of  this  License  (the right to make Adaptations) would be
 deemed to be a  distortion,  mutilation,  modification  or  other
 derogatory  action prejudicial to the Original Author’s honor and
 reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,  as  appropri‐
 ate,  this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the appli‐
 cable national law, to enable You  to  reasonably  exercise  Your
 right  under  Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adapta‐
 tions) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE  PARTIES  IN  WRITING,
 LICENSOR  OFFERS  THE  WORK AS‐IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING  THE  WORK,  EXPRESS,  IMPLIED,
 STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
 OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON‐
 INFRINGEMENT,  OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURA‐
 CY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT  DISCOV‐
 ERABLE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY  AP‐
 PLICABLE  LAW,  IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
 LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
 OR  EXEMPLARY  DAMAGES  ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF
 THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
    1.  This  License and the rights granted hereunder will termi‐
 nate automatically upon any breach by You of the  terms  of  this
 License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
 Collections from You under this License, however, will  not  have
 their  licenses  terminated provided such individuals or entities
 remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,  5,
 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    2.  Subject  to  the  above  terms and conditions, the license
 granted here is perpetual (for the  duration  of  the  applicable
 copyright  in  the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor re‐
 serves the right to release  the  Work  under  different  license
 terms  or  to  stop  distributing the Work at any time; provided,
 however that any such election will not serve  to  withdraw  this
 License  (or  any  other license that has been, or is required to
 be, granted under the terms of this License),  and  this  License
 will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stat‐
 ed above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
    1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or  a
 Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
 Work on the same terms and conditions as the license  granted  to
 You under this License.
    2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
 Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the  original  Work
 on  the  same  terms and conditions as the license granted to You
 under this License.
    3. If any provision of this License is invalid  or  unenforce‐
 able  under  applicable  law, it shall not affect the validity or
 enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
 without  further  action  by  the parties to this agreement, such
 provision shall be reformed to the minimum  extent  necessary  to
 make such provision valid and enforceable.
    4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived
 and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be
 in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
 or consent.
    5. This License constitutes the entire agreement  between  the
 parties  with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no un‐
 derstandings, agreements or representations with respect  to  the
 Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any addi‐
 tional provisions that may appear in any communication from  You.
 This  License  may  not  be  modified  without the mutual written
 agreement of the Licensor and You.
    6. The rights granted under, and  the  subject  matter  refer‐
 enced,  in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
 the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and  Artistic
 Works  (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of
 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996,  the  WIPO  Performances
 and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Conven‐
 tion (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject mat‐
 ter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License
 terms are sought to be enforced according  to  the  corresponding
 provisions  of  the  implementation of those treaty provisions in
 the applicable national law. If  the  standard  suite  of  rights
 granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights
 not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed
 to  be  included  in the License; this License is not intended to
 restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

 Under Section 7 of GPL version 3, you are granted additional

 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

 The Autoconf Configure Script Exception version 3 is below:
 .
		    AUTOCONF CONFIGURE SCRIPT EXCEPTION
			Version 3.0, 18 August 2009
 .
  Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 This Exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU
 General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3").  It applies to a given
 file that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file
 stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
 .
 The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of Autoconf's
 typical output under terms of the recipient's choice (including
 proprietary).
 .
 0. Definitions
 .
 "Covered Code" is the source or object code of a version of Autoconf
 that is a covered work under this License.
 .
 "Normally Copied Code" for a version of Autoconf means all parts of
 its Covered Code which that version can copy from its code (i.e., not
 from its input file) into its minimally verbose, non-debugging and
 non-tracing output.
 .
 "Ineligible Code" is Covered Code that is not Normally Copied Code.
 .
 1. Grant of Additional Permission.
 .
 You have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even if such
 propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3.  However, if
 by modifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible Code of the version you
 received to become Normally Copied Code of your modified version, then
 you void this Exception for the resulting covered work.  If you convey
 that resulting covered work, you must remove this Exception in accordance
 with the second paragraph of Section 7 of GPLv3.
 .
 2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.
 .
 The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption
 that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of
 the license of Autoconf.

bash: 
This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU Bash,
the Bourne Again SHell.

This package was put together by Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>, from
the following sources:

  bash:			ftp.gnu.org:/pub/gnu/bash/bash-4.3.tar.gz

Bash homepage:		 http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html

Copyright (C) 1987-2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Bash is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 3, or (at your option) any later
version.

Bash is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License
for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with Bash.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
On Debian systems, the complete text of the GNU General Public License
can be found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3'.

The Free Software Foundation has exempted Bash from the requirement of
Paragraph 2c of the General Public License.  This is to say, there is
no requirement for Bash to print a notice when it is started
interactively in the usual way.  We made this exception because users
and standards expect shells not to print such messages.  This
exception applies to any program that serves as a shell and that is
based primarily on Bash as opposed to other GNU software.

bsdmainutils: 
This is a collection of programs from 4.4BSD-Lite that have not (yet)
been re-written by FSF as GNU.  It was constructed for inclusion in
Debian Linux.  As programs found here become available from GNU sources,
they will be replaced.

This package was originally put together by Austin Donnelly
<and1000@debian.org>, but is heavily based on bsdutils, originally put
together by Ian Murdock <imurdock@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.  Please report any
problems or suggested additions or changes to Austin Donnelly.

Then the package has been maintained by Charles Briscoe-Smith
<cpbs@debian.org>.  I gathered data for the 1999-2001 calendar files
from various sources on the Internet, and I'd also like to thank Oliver
Elphick, Julian Gilbey, Daniel Martin and Jaldhar H. Vyas for providing
much useful data on the various religous calendars.  I have edited the
files they provided to fit calendar's requirements, so any errors should
be attributed to me.

After cpbs@debian.org, Marco d'Itri <md@linux.it> maintained it for
almost two years, before Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@debian.org> took over.
The package is now maintained by Graham Wilson <bob@decoy.wox.org>.

 non-exclusive license:
 .
 (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

     Contributions or its Contributor Version.
 .
 2.2. Effective Date
 .
 The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
 become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
 distributes such Contribution.
 .
 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
 .
 The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
 this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
 distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
 Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
 Contributor:
 .
 (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
     or
 .
 (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
     Version); or
 .
 (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
     its Contributions.
 .
 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
 or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
 the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
 .
 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
 .
 No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
 distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
 License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
 permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
 .
 2.5. Representation
 .
 Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
 Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
 to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
 .
 2.6. Fair Use
 .
 This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
 applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
 equivalents.
 .
 2.7. Conditions
 .
 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
 in Section 2.1.
 .
 3. Responsibilities
 -------------------
 .
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 .
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 Form.
 .
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 .
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 .
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
 .
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 .
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 .
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 License(s).
 .
 3.4. Notices
 .
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 .
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 .
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 jurisdiction.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 ---------------------------------------------------
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Termination
 --------------
 .
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 Your receipt of the notice.
 .
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
 .
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
 prior to termination shall survive termination.

cifs-utils: 


console-setup: 
This copyright file applies both to the source package console-setup
and the binary Debian packages built from it.

In short, if you use console-setup with precompiled keyboard files,
then all installed files are covered by simple permissive non-copyleft
free software licenses.  However, several of the tools used for the
compilation of the package (in particular 'ckbcomp' and 'bdf2psf') are
covered by GPL, version 2 or later.  The Perl program 'ckbcomp' is
installed in the system when console-setup is not used with
precompiled keyboard files.

The exact copyright terms follow.

All console fonts are public domain by nature.

The source BDF-fonts in the directory Fonts/bdf are distributed under
many different licenses, see in the file copyright.fonts for details.

The program 'bdf2psf' used to convert the fonts from BDF format to the
format used on the consoles of Linux and FreeBSD is covered by GPL,
version 2 or later.

The keyboard files are borrowed from the XKeyboardConfig package.  For
the licenses of the keyboard files, see the file copyright.xkb.  The
XKeyboardConfig package was downloaded from

http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkeyboard-config-0.8.tar.gz

Please notice, that Debian packages do not include the XKB files (they
are provided by a separate package xkb-data).  When, however, the
Debian package console-setup-mini is installed, it includes
precompiled version of the keyboard files, so the terms in the file
/usr/share/doc/keyboard-configuration/copyright.xkb.gz apply.

The manual pages are distributed according to GNU all-permissive license:

cpp-6: 
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, Fortran 95, Java, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Treelang compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gdc compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  http://bitbucket.org/goshawk/gdc     (for D)

The current gcc-6 source package is taken from the SVN gcc-6-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-6          libgnat-6        gnat-6-doc
C              gcc-6                              gcc-6-doc
C++            g++-6           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-6-doc
D              gdc-6
Fortran 95     gfortran-6      libgfortran3       gfortran-6-doc
Go             gccgo-6         libgo0
Java           gcj-6           libgcj10           libgcj-doc
Objective C    gobjc-6         libobjc2
Objective C++  gobjc++-6

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-6-dbg  libstdc++6-6-pic
D         libphobos-6-dev
Java      libgcj10-src libgcj10-dev  libgcj10-dbg

Additional packages include:

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

License: copyleft-next-0.3.0
                    copyleft-next 0.3.0 ("this License")
                          Release date: 2013-05-16
 .
 1. License Grants; No Trademark License
 .
    Subject to the terms of this License, I grant You:
 .
    a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
       copyright license, to reproduce, Distribute, prepare derivative works
       of, publicly perform and publicly display My Work.
 .
    b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
       patent license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell,
       offer for sale, and import Covered Works.
 .
    This License does not grant any rights in My name, trademarks, service
    marks, or logos.
 .
 2. Distribution: General Conditions
 .
    You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that You (i) inform
    recipients how they can obtain a copy of this License; (ii) satisfy the
    applicable conditions of sections 3 through 6; and (iii) preserve all
    Legal Notices contained in My Work (to the extent they remain
    pertinent). "Legal Notices" means copyright notices, license notices,
    license texts, and author attributions, but does not include logos,
    other graphical images, trademarks or trademark legends.
 .
 3. Conditions for Distributing Derived Works; Outbound GPL Compatibility
 .
    If You Distribute a Derived Work, You must license the entire Derived
    Work as a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such
    licensing. This condition may not be avoided through such means as
    separate Distribution of portions of the Derived Work. You may
    additionally license the Derived Work under the GPL, so that the
    recipient may further Distribute the Derived Work under either this
    License or the GPL.
 .
 4. Condition Against Further Restrictions; Inbound License Compatibility
 .
    When Distributing a Covered Work, You may not impose further
    restrictions on the exercise of rights in the Covered Work granted under
    this License. This condition is not excused merely because such
    restrictions result from Your compliance with conditions or obligations
    extrinsic to this License (such as a court order or an agreement with a
    third party).
 .
    However, You may Distribute a Covered Work incorporating material
    governed by a license that is both OSI-Approved and FSF-Free as of the
    release date of this License, provided that Your Distribution complies
    with such other license.
 .
 5. Conditions for Distributing Object Code
 .
    You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work, provided that
    you accompany the Object Code with a URL through which the Corresponding
    Source is made available, at no charge, by some standard or customary
    means of providing network access to source code.
 .
    If you Distribute the Object Code in a physical product or tangible
    storage medium ("Product"), the Corresponding Source must be available
    through such URL for two years from the date of Your most recent
    Distribution of the Object Code in the Product. However, if the Product
    itself contains or is accompanied by the Corresponding Source (made
    available in a customarily accessible manner), You need not also comply
    with the first paragraph of this section.
 .
    Each recipient of the Covered Work from You is an intended third-party
    beneficiary of this License solely as to this section 5, with the right
    to enforce its terms.
 .
 6. Symmetrical Licensing Condition for Upstream Contributions
 .
    If You Distribute a work to Me specifically for inclusion in or
    modification of a Covered Work (a "Patch"), and no explicit licensing
    terms apply to the Patch, You license the Patch under this License, to
    the extent of Your copyright in the Patch. This condition does not
    negate the other conditions of this License, if applicable to the Patch.
 .
 7. Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing
 .
    If I offer to license, for a fee, a Covered Work under terms other than
    a license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this
    License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the
    Copyleft-Next Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no
    longer subject to the conditions in sections 2 through 5.
 .
 8. Copyleft Sunset
 .
    The conditions in sections 2 through 5 no longer apply once fifteen
    years have elapsed from the date of My first Distribution of My Work
    under this License.
 .
 9. Pass-Through
 .
    When You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives
    a license to My Work from Me, subject to the terms of this License.
 .
 10. Termination
 .
     Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You
 .
     a) fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure
        such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or
 .
     b) initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding
        declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims)
        alleging that any part of My Work directly or indirectly infringes
        any patent.
 .
     Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered
     Works You subsequently obtain. Termination does not terminate the
     rights of those who have received copies or rights from You subject to
     this License.
 .
     To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary
     merely for running it, such permission is not terminable.
 .
 11. Later License Versions
 .
     The Copyleft-Next Project may release new versions of copyleft-next,
     designated by a distinguishing version number ("Later Versions").
     Unless I explicitly remove the option of Distributing Covered Works
     under Later Versions, You may Distribute Covered Works under any Later
     Version.
 .
 ** 12. No Warranty                                                       **
 **                                                                       **
 **     My Work is provided "as-is", without warranty. You bear the risk  **
 **     of using it. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each      **
 **     Distributor of My Work excludes the implied warranties of title,  **
 **     merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and             **
 **     non-infringement.                                                 **
 .
 ** 13. Limitation of Liability                                           **
 **                                                                       **
 **     To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any   **
 **     Distributor of My Work be liable to You for any damages           **
 **     whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or     **
 **     consequential damages, whether arising under contract, tort       **
 **     (including negligence), or otherwise, even where the Distributor  **
 **     knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages.  **
 .
 14. Severability
 .
     The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License
     does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
     this License. Such provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent
     necessary to make it valid and enforceable.
 .
 15. Definitions

 .
     "Derived Work" means a work of authorship that copies from, modifies,
     adapts, is based on, is a derivative work of, transforms, translates or

     using, or selling My Work, and excludes claims that would be infringed
     only as a consequence of further modification of My Work.

License: AFL-2.1
 The Academic Free License
 v. 2.1
 .
 This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original
 work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor")
 has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright
 notice for the Original Work:
 .
 Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1
 .
 1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a
 world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable
 license to do the following:
 .
 a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
 .
 b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the
 Original Work;
 .
 c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to
 the public;
 .
 d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
 .
 e) to display the Original Work publicly.
 .
 2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
 royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under
 patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in
 the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and
 offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.
 .
 3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the
 preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and
 all available documentation describing how to modify the Original
 Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the
 Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original
 Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy
 this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code
 in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit
 inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor
 continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the
 address of that information repository in a notice immediately
 following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
 .
 4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor
 the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their
 trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote
 products derived from this Original Work without express prior written
 permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
 grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or
 any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated
 herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to
 sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
 defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of
 Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing
 in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
 licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work
 that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
 .
 5) This section intentionally omitted.
 .
 6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any
 Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark
 notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any
 notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
 "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any
 Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution
 Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
 modified the Original Work.
 .
 7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor
 warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent
 rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are
 sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission
 of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as
 expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original
 Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT
 WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
 the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
 WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential
 part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder
 except under this disclaimer.
 .
 8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal
 theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
 otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct,
 indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
 character arising as a result of this License or the use of the
 Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
 goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
 all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability
 shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting
 from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
 limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
 limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
 and limitation may not apply to You.
 .
 9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the
 Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort
 under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to
 the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another
 written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to
 create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise
 any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do
 so except under the terms of this License (or another written
 agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by
 U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by
 international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights
 granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of
 this License and all of its terms and conditions.
 .
 10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate
 automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted
 to You by this License as of the date You commence an action,
 including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any
 licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This
 termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent
 infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software
 or hardware.
 .
 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating
 to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction
 wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary
 business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its
 conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations
 Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
 expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of
 this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
 requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101
 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international
 treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
 .
 12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License
 or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be
 entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without
 limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in
 connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This
 section shall survive the termination of this License.
 .
 13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
 concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License
 is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to
 the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
 .
 14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this
 License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a
 legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the
 terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity
 that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with
 you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power,
 direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
 entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
 percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
 ownership of such entity.
 .
 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not
 otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and
 Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such
 uses by You.
 .

		     SMAIL GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       (Clarified 11 Feb 1988)

 Copyright (C)  1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr
 Copyright (C)  1992 Ronald S. Karr
 Copyleft (GNU) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also
 use this wording to make the terms for other programs.

  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the
mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is
intended to give everyone the right to share SMAIL.  To make sure that
you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
the rights.  Hence this license agreement.

  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of SMAIL, that you receive source code or else can get it
if you want it, that you can change SMAIL or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of SMAIL, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone
finds out that there is no warranty for SMAIL.  If SMAIL is modified by
someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what
they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on our reputation.

  Therefore we (Landon Curt Noll and Ronald S. Karr) make the following 
terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change 
SMAIL.


			COPYING POLICIES

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of SMAIL source code
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice "Copyright
(C) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr" (or with whatever year is
appropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this
License Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the SMAIL program a copy of this License
Agreement along with the program.  You may charge a distribution fee
for the physical act of transferring a copy.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of SMAIL or any portion of it,
and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of
Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,
    that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of SMAIL or
    any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third
    parties on terms identical to those contained in this License
    Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive
    warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).

    c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
    protection in exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other program under the scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute SMAIL (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal
    shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for non-commercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for
all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include
source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the
operating system on which the executable file runs.

  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL
except as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL is void and
your rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be
automatically terminated.  However, parties who have received computer
software programs from you with this License Agreement will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. If you wish to incorporate parts of SMAIL into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to Landon
Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr via the Free Software Foundation at 51
Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.  We have not yet
worked out a simple rule that can be stated here, but we will often
permit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of preserving the
free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
the sharing and reuse of software.

Your comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our
software are welcome!  This contract was based on the contract made by
the Free Software Foundation.  Please contact the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301,
USA, or call (617) 542-5942 for details on copylefted material in
general.

		       NO WARRANTY

  BECAUSE SMAIL IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY NO
WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, LANDON CURT NOLL & RONALD S. KARR AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE SMAIL "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF SMAIL IS WITH
YOU.  SHOULD SMAIL PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL LANDON CURT NOLL &
RONALD S. KARR AND/OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE
SMAIL AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS) SMAIL, EVEN IF YOU HAVE
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY
ANY OTHER PARTY.

ed: 
This is Debian GNU's prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU ed
utility.  The classic unix line editor, ed is a line-oriented text
editor.  It is used to create, display, modify and otherwise
manipulate text files.

This package was put together by me, James Troup <james@nocrew.org>,
from the GNU sources, which I obtained from:

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ed/ed-0.7.tar.bz2

The changes were small:

o adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
  various debian/* files.
o buf.c (open_sbuf): use tmpfile() and not mktemp().
o glbl.c (exec_global), io.c (read_stream, get_stream_line), main.c
  (main, exec_command, get_matching_node_addr, strip_escapes), re.c
  (get_compiled_pattern), sub.c (extract_subst_template, 
  substitute_matching_text): parentheses to quiet -Wall.
o ed.1: various fixes by Matt Kraai <kraai@alumni.carnegiemellon.edu>

 The source files refer to `the file COPYING in the main directory of the Linux
 distribution', so that must be the GNU General Public License Version 2.

ffmpeg: 
Format: https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/
Upstream-Name: FFmpeg
Upstream-Contact: ffmpeg-devel@ffmpeg.org
Source: https://ffmpeg.org
Comment:
 Most files in FFmpeg are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License
 version 2.1 or later (LGPL v2.1+), but some optional parts of FFmpeg are
 licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 or later (GPL v2+)
 and a few have different, but compatible licenses.
 .
 For building the default Debian packages some of the GPL licensed files are used,
 so the resulting binaries are licensed under GPL v2+.
 For libavcodec/libavfilter an extra flavor is built, which links against external
 libraries licensed under the Apache License 2.0, which makes it effectively licensed
 under the GPL v3+
 The HTML documentation /usr/share/doc/ffmpeg/manual/*.html in the ffmpeg-doc
 package is effectively licensed under GPL-3+, because during its creation
 the GPL-3+ licensed file doc/t2h.pm is used.
 .
 FFmpeg can also be combined with non-free libraries, which would make the
 resulting binaries unredistributable.
 But this is not done for the Debian packages.

5.	CONFIDENTIALITY

5.1.	Obligations.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that any documentation
relating to the Software, and any other information (if such other information
is identified as confidential or should be recognized as confidential under the
circumstances) provided to Licensee by Broadcom hereunder (collectively,
“Confidential Information”) constitute the confidential and proprietary
information of Broadcom, and that Licensee’s protection thereof is an essential
condition to Licensee’s use and possession of the Software.  Licensee shall
retain all Confidential Information in strict confidence and not disclose it to
any third party or use it in any way except under a written agreement with
terms and conditions at least as protective as the terms of this Section.
Licensee will exercise at least the same amount of diligence in preserving the
secrecy of the Confidential Information as it uses in preserving the secrecy of
its own most valuable confidential information, but in no event less than
reasonable diligence.  Information shall not be considered Confidential
Information if and to the extent that it: (i) was in the public domain at the
time it was disclosed or has entered the public domain through no fault of
Licensee; (ii) was known to Licensee, without restriction, at the time of
disclosure as proven by the files of Licensee in existence at the time of
disclosure; or (iii) becomes known to Licensee, without restriction, from a
source other than Broadcom without breach of this Agreement by Licensee and
otherwise not in violation of Broadcom’s rights.

5.2.	Return of Confidential Information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, all
documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Broadcom
Confidential Information and all copies thereof which are in the possession of
Licensee shall be and remain the property of Broadcom, and shall be promptly
returned to Broadcom upon written request by Broadcom or upon termination of
this Agreement.

6.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO
EVENT SHALL BROADCOM OR ANY OF BROADCOM’S LICENSORS HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL BROADCOM’S LIABILITY WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY
LICENSEE FOR SOFTWARE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.  THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

7.	MISCELLANEOUS

7.1.	Export Regulations. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE IS
SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES AND OTHER APPLICABLE EXPORT-RELATED LAWS AND
REGULATIONS AND THAT YOU MAY NOT EXPORT, RE-EXPORT OR TRANSFER THE SOFTWARE OR
ANY DIRECT PRODUCT OF THE SOFTWARE EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THOSE LAWS.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, EXPORT, RE-EXPORT OR TRANSFER OF THE SOFTWARE
TO CUBA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA, SUDAN AND SYRIA IS PROHIBITED.

7.2	Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns, provided,
however that Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligation
hereunder, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, without
the prior written consent of Broadcom, and any such attempted assignment shall
be void.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may assign this Agreement to
a successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this
Agreement relates that is not a competitor of Broadcom.

7.3.	Governing Law; Venue.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
California without regard to any conflict-of-laws rules, and the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby excluded.
The sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter
hereof shall be the state and federal courts located in the County of Orange,
California, and both parties hereby consent to such jurisdiction and venue.

7.4.	Severability.  All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall, if
possible, be construed in a manner which makes them valid, but in the event any
term or provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected if the illegal or
unenforceable provision does not materially affect the intent of this
Agreement.  If the illegal or unenforceable provision materially affects the
intent of the parties to this Agreement, this Agreement shall become
terminated.

7.5.	Equitable Relief.  Licensee hereby acknowledges that its breach of this
Agreement would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Broadcom that
may be difficult to ascertain and that a remedy at law would be inadequate.
Accordingly, Licensee agrees that Broadcom shall have the right to seek and
obtain immediate injunctive relief to enforce obligations under the Agreement
in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have.

7.6.	Waiver.  The waiver of, or failure to enforce, any breach or default
hereunder shall not constitute the waiver of any other or subsequent breach or
default.

7.7.	Entire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire Agreement
between the parties and supersedes any and all prior proposals, agreements and
representations between them, whether written or oral concerning the Software.
This Agreement may be changed only by mutual agreement of the parties in
writing.

 Use of NVIDIA's products requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, the
 hardware, and a personal computer. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright
 laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual
 property laws and treaties.  The SOFTWARE may be protected by various
 patents, and is not sold, and instead is only licensed for use, strictly
 in accordance with this document.  The hardware is protected by various
 patents, and is sold, but this agreement does not cover that sale, since
 it may not necessarily be sold as a package with the SOFTWARE.  This
 agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of the SOFTWARE LICENSE only.
 .
 1.  DEFINITIONS

 the following non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the
 SOFTWARE, with the following limitations:

 2.1.1  Rights.  Customer may install and use multiple copies of the
 SOFTWARE on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers,
 and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for Customer's
 use within Customer's Enterprise. "Enterprise" shall mean individual use
 by Customer or any legal entity (such as a corporation or university)
 and the subsidiaries it owns by more than fifty percent (50%).
 .

g++-6: 
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, Fortran 95, Java, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Treelang compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gdc compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  http://bitbucket.org/goshawk/gdc     (for D)

The current gcc-6 source package is taken from the SVN gcc-6-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-6          libgnat-6        gnat-6-doc
C              gcc-6                              gcc-6-doc
C++            g++-6           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-6-doc
D              gdc-6
Fortran 95     gfortran-6      libgfortran3       gfortran-6-doc
Go             gccgo-6         libgo0
Java           gcj-6           libgcj10           libgcj-doc
Objective C    gobjc-6         libobjc2
Objective C++  gobjc++-6

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-6-dbg  libstdc++6-6-pic
D         libphobos-6-dev
Java      libgcj10-src libgcj10-dev  libgcj10-dbg

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-6-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-6-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-6-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnatvsn-dev, libgnatvsn6   GNAT version library
libgnatprj-dev, libgnatprj6   GNAT Project Manager library

C:
cpp-6, cpp-6-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

Java:
gij                             The Java bytecode interpreter and VM
libgcj-common                   Common files for the Java run-time
libgcj10-awt                    The Abstract Windowing Toolkit
libgcj10-jar                    Java ARchive for the Java run-time

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

gcc-6: 
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, Fortran 95, Java, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Treelang compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gdc compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  http://bitbucket.org/goshawk/gdc     (for D)

The current gcc-6 source package is taken from the SVN gcc-6-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-6          libgnat-6        gnat-6-doc
C              gcc-6                              gcc-6-doc
C++            g++-6           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-6-doc
D              gdc-6
Fortran 95     gfortran-6      libgfortran3       gfortran-6-doc
Go             gccgo-6         libgo0
Java           gcj-6           libgcj10           libgcj-doc
Objective C    gobjc-6         libobjc2
Objective C++  gobjc++-6

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-6-dbg  libstdc++6-6-pic
D         libphobos-6-dev
Java      libgcj10-src libgcj10-dev  libgcj10-dbg

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-6-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-6-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-6-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnatvsn-dev, libgnatvsn6   GNAT version library
libgnatprj-dev, libgnatprj6   GNAT Project Manager library

C:
cpp-6, cpp-6-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

Java:
gij                             The Java bytecode interpreter and VM
libgcj-common                   Common files for the Java run-time
libgcj10-awt                    The Abstract Windowing Toolkit
libgcj10-jar                    Java ARchive for the Java run-time

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

 GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
 .
 Version 3.1, 31 March 2009
 .
 Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
 permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
 bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
 the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
 .
 When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
 certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
 program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
 non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
 header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.
 .
 0. Definitions.
 .
 A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
 Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
 interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
 on the Runtime Library.
 .
 "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
 modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
 the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
 subsequent versions published by the FSF.
 .
 "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
 modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
 the license of GCC.
 .
 "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
 target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
 input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
 phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
 format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
 for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
 .
 The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
 non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
 Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
 use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
 part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
 understood as starting with the output of the generators or
 preprocessors.
 .
 A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
 with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
 work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
 optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
 Eligible Compilation Process.
 .
 1. Grant of Additional Permission.
 .
 You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
 combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
 propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
 all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
 may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
 consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
 .
 2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
 .
 The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
 presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
 requirements of the license of GCC.

gettext-base: 
This is the Debian prepackaged version of the GNU gettext utilities.
GNU gettext was written by Ulrich Drepper <drepper@gnu.org>.
emacs po-mode was written by François Pinard <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>.

This package was first created by Erick Branderhorst <branderh@debian.org>,
and is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>.

This release has been built using the sources from:

http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext/gettext-0.19.8.1.tar.xz

The changes were fairly minimal, and consisted solely of adding
various debian/* files to the distribution.

License: The main library is licensed under GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1+, Gnutls Extra (which is currently
just the openssl wrapper library), build system, testsuite and commandline
utilities are licenced under the GNU General Public License version 3+.  The
Guile bindings use the same license as the respective underlying library,
i.e. LGPLv2.1+ for the main library and GPLv3+ for Gnutls extra.

However to be able to use and link against libgnutls a program needs to be
available under a license compatible with LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+ since GnuTLS
requires nettle which requires GMP. GMP (>= 6.0.0) is dual licensed
LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+. Starting with 3.5.7 libunistring is needed, too. It also
is dual licensed LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+ (libunistring 0.9.7 and above, earlier
version were LGPLv3+ only.)

Excerpt from upstream's README:

LICENSING
=========

Since GnuTLS version 3.1.10, the core library has been released under
the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or later.

Note, however, that version 6.0.0 and later of the gmplib library used
by GnuTLS are distributed under a LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+ dual license, and
as such binaries of this library need to adhere to either LGPLv3+ or
GPLv2+ license.




The GNU LGPL applies to the main GnuTLS library, while the
included applications as well as gnutls-openssl
library are under the GNU GPL version 3.  The gnutls library is
located in the lib/ and libdane/ directories, while the applications
in src/ and, the gnutls-openssl library is at extra/.

For any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in this package
note that the range specifies every single year in that closed interval.

Author: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
Comment: http://ccodearchive.net/info/str/hex.html
License: CC0 license
  Statement of Purpose

  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

      the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
      moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
      publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
      rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
      rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
      database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
      other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

      No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
      Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
      Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
      Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

groff-base: 
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU groff
document formatting system. 
GNU groff was written by James Clark <jjc@jclark.com>.  
It is now maintained by Ted Harding <ted.harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk> and
Werner Lemberg <wl@gnu.org>.

This Debian package was previously maintained by Fabrizio Polacco
<fpolacco@debian.org>.
It is now maintained by Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>.

The original tarball came from <URL:ftp://groff.ffii.org/pub/groff/>:
  48fa768dd6fdeb7968041dd5ae8e2b02  groff-1.20.1.tar.gz
and was simply renamed to groff_1.20.1.orig.tar.gz.

Some patches have been applied to groff outside the debian directory.

The Debian diff also appends /usr/share/groff/tmac to the default macro path
for compatibility with versions of groff earlier than 1.17 (patch by Colin
Watson).

The groff manual is also distributed under the terms of the GNU Free
Documentation License version 1.3.  On Debian systems, this is available in
/usr/share/common-licenses/GFDL-1.3 as part of the base-files package.
However, Debian does not consider this free when the Front-Cover Texts or
Back-Cover Texts options are used.  groff is distributed with a LICENSES
file containing the following text (excerpted):

  The groff program is a free software project.  It is licensed under the GNU
  General Public License (GNU GPL), version 3 or later.
  
  The file COPYING in the top directory of the groff source package contains a
  copy of the GPL that was downloaded from the GNU web site
  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt at 3 jan 2009.
  
  All files part of groff are licensed under this version of the GPL (or
  licenses which are compatible with the GPL). You are free to choose
  version 3 or any subsequent version of the GPL.

I e-mailed the upstream maintainer to clarify the intent of this. Here is
the relevant part of the reply:

  From: Werner LEMBERG <wl@gnu.org>
  To: cjwatson@debian.org
  Subject: Re: Clarifying the scope of groff/LICENSE

  This is the intention, of course.

  Sigh.  I haven't found time to revert the FDL stuff back to GPL.  It
  basically affects only Bernd Warken and me, and we have both agreed to
  return to GPL in case FDL makes problems.

(Note that this e-mail predates the current wording in LICENSES.)

It is therefore my understanding that the copyright holders of the groff
documentation intend it to be distributable under the terms of the GPL
version 3 or later.  The reference above to the FDL text in
/usr/share/common-licenses/ is for information only.

The file tmac/hyphen.us is identical to the file hyphen.tex, part of the TeX
system written by Donald E. Knuth; the master file can be found at:

  ftp://labrea.stanford.edu/pub/tex/dist/lib/hyphen.tex

It has been renamed for consistency, i.e., to make patterns available under
the filenames hyphen.<language>, e.g. hyphen.de or hyphen.uk.

  Unlimited copying and redistribution of this file are permitted as long
  as this file is not modified. Modifications are permitted, but only if

License: Artistic-2
 			 The "Artistic License"
 .
 				Preamble
 .
 The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
 Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
 while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
 the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
 reasonable modifications.
 .
 Definitions:
 .
 	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
 	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
 	created through textual modification.
 .
 	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
 	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
 	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
 .
 	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
 	copyrights for the package.
 .
 	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
 	this Package.
 .
 	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
 	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
 	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
 	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
 	as a market that must bear the fee.)
 .
 	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
 	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
 	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
 	under the same conditions they received it.
 .
 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
 duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
 .
 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
 derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
 modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 .
 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
 that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
 when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
 following:
 .
     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
     Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
     an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
     site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
     your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 .
     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
 .
     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
     with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
     a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
     documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
 .
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
 executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
     together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
     to get the Standard Version.
 .
     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
     the Package with your modifications.
 .
     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
     document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
     with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
 .
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
 Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
 Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
 you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
 commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
 distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
 product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
 an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
 form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
 interpreter is so embedded.
 .
 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
 output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
 under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
 them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
 Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
 Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
 binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
 neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
 fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
 not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
 Package.
 .
 7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
 languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
 emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
 Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
 equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
 not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
 regression tests for the language.
 .
 8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
 permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
 when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
 to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
 construed as a distribution of this Package.
 .
 9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
 products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
 .
 10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 .

Comment:
 Delete the clause 3 (the advertising clause), as per announce
 by the University of California, Berkeley
 <ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change>:
 July 22, 1999
 .
 To All Licensees, Distributors of Any Version of BSD:
 .
 As you know, certain of the Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD") source
 code files require that further distributions of products containing all or
 portions of the software, acknowledge within their advertising materials
 that such products contain software developed by UC Berkeley and its
 contributors.
 .
 Specifically, the provision reads:
 .
 "     * 3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software
       *    must display the following acknowledgement:
       *    This product includes software developed by the University of
       *    California, Berkeley and its contributors."
 .
 Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer required to
 include the acknowledgement within advertising materials.  Accordingly, the
 foregoing paragraph of those BSD Unix files containing it is hereby deleted
 in its entirety.

keyboard-configuration: 
This copyright file applies both to the source package console-setup
and the binary Debian packages built from it.

In short, if you use console-setup with precompiled keyboard files,
then all installed files are covered by simple permissive non-copyleft
free software licenses.  However, several of the tools used for the
compilation of the package (in particular 'ckbcomp' and 'bdf2psf') are
covered by GPL, version 2 or later.  The Perl program 'ckbcomp' is
installed in the system when console-setup is not used with
precompiled keyboard files.

The exact copyright terms follow.

All console fonts are public domain by nature.

The source BDF-fonts in the directory Fonts/bdf are distributed under
many different licenses, see in the file copyright.fonts for details.

The program 'bdf2psf' used to convert the fonts from BDF format to the
format used on the consoles of Linux and FreeBSD is covered by GPL,
version 2 or later.

The keyboard files are borrowed from the XKeyboardConfig package.  For
the licenses of the keyboard files, see the file copyright.xkb.  The
XKeyboardConfig package was downloaded from

http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkeyboard-config-0.8.tar.gz

Please notice, that Debian packages do not include the XKB files (they
are provided by a separate package xkb-data).  When, however, the
Debian package console-setup-mini is installed, it includes
precompiled version of the keyboard files, so the terms in the file
/usr/share/doc/keyboard-configuration/copyright.xkb.gz apply.

The manual pages are distributed according to GNU all-permissive license:

libav-tools: 
Format: https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/
Upstream-Name: FFmpeg
Upstream-Contact: ffmpeg-devel@ffmpeg.org
Source: https://ffmpeg.org
Comment:
 Most files in FFmpeg are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License
 version 2.1 or later (LGPL v2.1+), but some optional parts of FFmpeg are
 licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 or later (GPL v2+)
 and a few have different, but compatible licenses.
 .
 For building the default Debian packages some of the GPL licensed files are used,
 so the resulting binaries are licensed under GPL v2+.
 For libavcodec/libavfilter an extra flavor is built, which links against external
 libraries licensed under the Apache License 2.0, which makes it effectively licensed
 under the GPL v3+
 The HTML documentation /usr/share/doc/ffmpeg/manual/*.html in the ffmpeg-doc
 package is effectively licensed under GPL-3+, because during its creation
 the GPL-3+ licensed file doc/t2h.pm is used.
 .
 FFmpeg can also be combined with non-free libraries, which would make the
 resulting binaries unredistributable.
 But this is not done for the Debian packages.

       otherwise, you must put a sentence like this

         Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package,
         which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright
         by the University of Cambridge, England.

       somewhere reasonably visible in your documentation and in any relevant

       it must acknowledge it, but if package B is software that includes package
       A, the condition is not imposed on package B (unless it uses PCRE

    4. If PCRE is embedded in any software that is released under the GNU

    2. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented, either by

       PCRE in software that you distribute to others, commercially or
       otherwise, you must put a sentence like this

         Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package,
         which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright
         by the University of Cambridge, England.

       somewhere reasonably visible in your documentation and in any relevant

       the source, that is, to

         ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/

       intended to apply to whole chains of software. If package A includes PCRE,
       it must acknowledge it, but if package B is software that includes package
       A, the condition is not imposed on package B (unless it uses PCRE
       independently).

    3. Altered versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be

    4. If PCRE is embedded in any software that is released under the GNU

 * This is the header file for the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 * The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
 * written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 * This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
 *
 * Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
 * This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
 * except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
 * with every copy.
 *
 * To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
 * MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
 * needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
 * will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.
 *
 * Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h'
 * header definitions; now uses stuff from dpkg's config.h
 *  - Ian Jackson <ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu>.
 * Still in the public domain.
 *
 * Josh Coalson: made some changes to integrate with libFLAC.
 * Still in the public domain, with no warranty.

 Introduction
 ============
 .
  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.
 .
  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
 .
  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
 .
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
 .
    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
 .
    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')
 .
  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
 .

 Legal Terms
 ===========

  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.
 .
  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source

  engine'.

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.

  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

This package was downloaded from:

    <http://www.openldap.org/>

The upstream distribution has been repackaged to remove the RFCs and
Internet-Drafts included in the upstream distribution, since the Internet
Society license does not meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  The
schema files that contain verbatim text from RFCs or Internet-Drafts have
similarly been removed and are replaced during the package build with
versions stripped of the literal RFC or Internet-Draft text.

This license was present in the copies of several schema files and one
LDIF file as distributed upstream.  The relevant content has been removed
except where it is purely functional (descriptions of an LDAP schema).
The copyright notice has been retained with a clarifying comment.  The
provisions in the above license that prohibit modification therefore
should no longer apply to any files distributed with the Debian package.

Several files in libraries/libldap also reference this license as the
copyright on ABNF sequences embedded as comments in those files.  These
too are purely functional interface specifications distributed as part of
the LDAP protocol standard and do not contain creative work such as
free-form text.

Stephen,

"There is no restriction on modifications and derived works" on the work I
did for the openldap server as long as this is consistent with the openldap
license. Please forward this email to Kurt so he does the appropriate
changes to the files to reflect this.

Subject: Re: Mark Adamson license in OpenLDAP source

Hi Stephen,

  I don't see how this conflicts with the Debian FSG. The first statement
in the copyright pertaining to CMU say only that we don't license out the
software.  The second mention denies the right to say things like,
"Now! Powered by software from Carnegie Mellon!"   There is no restriction
on modifications and derived works.

Steven,

The OpenLDAP Foundation believes it the Regents' statement grants a
license to redistribute derived works and is confident that the University,
who is quite aware of our actions (as they actively participate in them),
does not consider our actions to infringe on their rights.  You are
welcomed to your opinions. I suggest, however, that before you rely
on your or other people's opinions (including ours), that you consult
with a lawyer familiar with applicable law and the particulars of your
situation.

The Foundation sees no reason for it to expend its limited resources
seeking clarifications which it believes are unnecessary.  You are,
of course, welcomed to expend time and energy seeking clarifications
you think are necessary.  I suggest you contact University's general
counsel office (http://www.umich.edu/~vpgc/).

Regards, Kurt

m4: 
This is the Debian prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU m4 macro processor.
GNU `m4' has been originally written by René Seindal, from Denmark,
with subsequent changes by François Pinard and other volunteers on
the Internet. A list of contributors to the GNU program is in the
THANKS file in the source distribution, or appended below in the
binary package.

This package was first put together by Ian Jackson <ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu>
and is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>.

The GNU sources for this release were obtained from

http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.18.tar.xz

The changes were very minimal - merely adding support for the Debian
package maintenance scheme, by adding various debian/* files.

         Changes:
           * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
           * Pared down the package to just the documentation bits, and some
             build infrastructure.
         Parts of the GNU Make build structure remain in this package.

makedev: 
This package is maintained for Debian by Bdale Garbee, <bdale@gag.com>.

It was downloaded from ftp.redhat.com, as a source .rpm from the 5.1 release.

Copyright:

No explicit copyright is asserted.  Nick Holloway is the earliest author 
recorded in the sourcecode.  I queried him for an explicit statement 
regarding the license status of this work, and this is his reply:

 It was never explictly released as GPL, as that would have required
 including the file COPYING which would have been much larger than the
 actual MAKEDEV script (I was also too lazy to find out what incantations
 needed to be made).  However, it is intended to be used as anyone sees
 fit, and the statement under "Copying Policy" is "Freely Redistributable"
 (see MAKEDEV.lsm from any of the releases I made).
 
 The more recent modifications were done by Michael K. Johnson at
 Redhat.  I think the understanding was that he would be taking over the
 maintenance of MAKEDEV (our discussion took place last September).
 
 The only previous history was (according to an old posting to
 comp.os.linux) that I started with Jim Winstead's script.
 
 So, as far as I am concerned, it is consistentwith the Debian FSG.

License: EPL-1.0
 Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
 .
 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
 LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
 CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 .
 1. DEFINITIONS
 .
 "Contribution" means:
 .
 a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
 distributed under this Agreement, and
 .
 b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
 .
 i) changes to the Program, and
 .
 ii) additions to the Program;
 .
 where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
 distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
 Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or
 anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
 additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software
 distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
 and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
 .
 "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
 .
 "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
 necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
 combined with the Program.
 .
 "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
 .
 "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
 including all Contributors.
 .
 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 .
 a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
 Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
 reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
 distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
 such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
 .
 b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
 Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
 Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
 transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
 object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
 Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
 Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
 covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
 other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
 licensed hereunder.
 .
 c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
 its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
 Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
 intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
 any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
 infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
 exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
 assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
 needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
 allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
 acquire that license before distributing the Program.
 .
 d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
 copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
 set forth in this Agreement.
 .
 3. REQUIREMENTS
 .
 A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
 its own license agreement, provided that:
 .
 a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
 .
 b) its license agreement:
 .
 i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
 conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
 and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
 and fitness for a particular purpose;
 .
 ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
 damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
 damages, such as lost profits;
 .
 iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
 by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
 .
 iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
 Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on
 or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
 .
 When the Program is made available in source code form:
 .
 a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
 .
 b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
 .
 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within
 the Program.
 .
 Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
 if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
 the originator of the Contribution.
 .
 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 .
 Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
 respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
 intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
 includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
 which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.  Therefore,
 if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
 Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
 every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
 damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and
 other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
 Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
 Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
 product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
 or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
 infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
 a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
 b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
 Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
 negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at
 its own expense.
 .
 For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
 offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
 that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
 warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
 such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
 Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
 Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
 court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
 Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
 .
 5. NO WARRANTY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
 "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
 NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
 Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
 and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
 exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the
 risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to
 or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
 operations.
 .
 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
 CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
 SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
 LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
 CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
 ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
 EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
 OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. GENERAL
 .
 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
 remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
 parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
 necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
 (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
 infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
 under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
 All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
 comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
 not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
 such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
 Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
 reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
 and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
 and survive.
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
 order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
 modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
 publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
 time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
 Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
 Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
 Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
 be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
 Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
 Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
 Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
 (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
 stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
 licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
 whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the
 Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
 .
 This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
 intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
 Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
 after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
 in any resulting litigation.

 intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
 any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
 infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
 exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
 assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
 needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
 allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
 acquire that license before distributing the Program.
 .
 d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
 copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
 set forth in this Agreement.
 .
 3. REQUIREMENTS
 .
 A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
 its own license agreement, provided that:
 .
 a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
 .
 b) its license agreement:
 .
 i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
 conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
 and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
 and fitness for a particular purpose;
 .
 ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
 damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
 damages, such as lost profits;
 .
 iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
 by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
 .
 iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
 Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on
 or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
 .
 When the Program is made available in source code form:
 .
 a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
 .
 b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
 .
 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within
 the Program.
 .
 Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
 if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
 the originator of the Contribution.
 .
 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 .
 Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
 respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
 intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
 includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
 which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.  Therefore,
 if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
 Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
 every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
 damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and
 other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
 Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
 Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
 product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
 or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
 infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
 a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
 b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
 Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
 negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at
 its own expense.
 .
 For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
 offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
 that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
 warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
 such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
 Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
 Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
 court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
 Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
 .
 5. NO WARRANTY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
 "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
 NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
 Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
 and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
 exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the
 risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to
 or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
 operations.
 .
 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
 CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
 SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
 LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
 CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
 ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
 EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
 OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. GENERAL
 .
 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
 remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
 parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
 necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
 (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
 infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
 under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
 All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
 comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
 not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
 such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
 Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
 reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
 and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
 and survive.
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
 order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
 modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
 publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
 time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
 Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
 Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
 Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
 be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
 Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
 Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
 Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
 (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
 stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
 licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
 whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the
 Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
 .
 This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
 intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
 Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
 after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
 in any resulting litigation.

         Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package,
         which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright
         by the University of Cambridge, England.

       somewhere reasonably visible in your documentation and in any relevant

       intended to apply to whole chains of software. If package A includes PCRE,
       it must acknowledge it, but if package B is software that includes package
       A, the condition is not imposed on package B (unless it uses PCRE

Comment:
 The overall licence of the OpenSSH upstream code amounts to BSD-3-clause or
 various less restrictive licences, with the additional restrictions that
 derived versions must be clearly marked as such and that if derived works
 are incompatible with the RFC-specified protocol then they must be called
 by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".

Comment:
 The overall licence of the OpenSSH upstream code amounts to BSD-3-clause or
 various less restrictive licences, with the additional restrictions that
 derived versions must be clearly marked as such and that if derived works
 are incompatible with the RFC-specified protocol then they must be called
 by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".

    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or
    any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no
    Invariant Sections, with no Front-Cover Texts, and with no Back-Cover
    Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU

The complete text of the GNU FDL 1.1, taken from Appendix A to parted.info,
follows.

A.1 GNU Free Documentation License
==================================

                        Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
     and is addressed as "you".

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has less than five).

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and
          add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications",
          preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all
          the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgments and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
          conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgments", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

A.1.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

  If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

  If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

Comment:
 ----------------------------------------
 The first two alternative licenses, as retrieved at
  Thu, 09 May 2013 00:00:38 +0300
 are included at the end of this file.
 .
 Part of this file carries the following comment:
 .
  FYI: This is the "Super-Fast" algorithm mentioned by Bob Jenkins in
  (http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html)
  It is by Paul Hsieh (c) 2004 and is analysed here
  http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/hash.html
  license terms are here:
  http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/weblicense.html
 .
 As of Thu, 09 May 2013 00:02:53 +0300, the "weblicense.html" document
 states:
 .
  Unless otherwise accompanied by another included license, the text
  and explicitly rendered exposition of all content under this website
  is covered by the Paul Hsieh exposition license.
 .
  For the specific coverage of raw source code (only) obtained from
  this website, you have the option of using the old-style BSD license
  to use the code instead of other the licenses. This option has been
  provided for people who can't figure out what I talking about with my
  derivative license, or who are using a old-style BSD compatible license.
 .
  Unless otherwise accompanied by another included license, derivative
  work by taking portions or ideas from the above mentioned exposition
  are covered by the Paul Hsieh derivative license.
 .
  Examples: Unless covered by another accompanying license, source code
  shown on my website can be used freely under the derivative license,
  (and may be distributed under a public domain license, whether compiled
  into another program or not, for example) however the font, comments,
  colors or any layout details associated to that source code in its
  exposition are covered by the exposition license.
 .
  The entire English text describing the code is also covered under the
  exposition license and thus cannot be copied at all outside the limits
  of fair use.
 .
  Images and graphics shown on this website are entirely covered by the
  exposition license.
 .
  If a proprietary vendor wishes to create a closed source object code
  based product using source covered by the derivative license they may
  do so. However if this vendor then wished to distribute the original
  source code, they may not apply any licensing terms which contradict
  the original derivative license covering the derivative code.
 .
  If your code is compatible with the old style BSD license and you
  wish to avoid the burden of explicitely protecting code you obtained
  from here from misrepresentation then you can simply cover it with
  the old-style BSD license.
 .
 It is therefore assumed that the relevant part of the Perl source
 is licensed under either the "Paul Hsieh derivative license" or
 the "the old-style BSD license", which have been included at
 the end of file with the codenames HSIEH-DERIVATIVE and HSIEH-BSD.
 .
 Additionally, the "hash.html" document has this statement for the
 relevant source code:
 .
  IMPORTANT NOTE: Since there has been a lot of interest for the code
  below, I have decided to additionally provide it under the LGPL 2.1
  license. This provision applies to the code below only and not to any
  other code including other source archives or listings from this site
  unless otherwise specified.
 .
  The LGPL 2.1 is not necessarily a more liberal license than my
  derivative license, but this additional licensing makes the code
  available to more developers. Note that this does not give you
  multi-licensing rights. You can only use the code under one of the
  licenses at a time.
 .

Comment:
 ----------------------------------------
 The main license applies to most of the code:
 .
  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the same terms as Perl itself.
 .
 but portions of it have been taken from a BSD variant and are licensed
 under the terms of the "BSD-3-clause-GENERIC" license included in this file.
 .
 dist/PathTools/Cwd.pm states:
 .
  Portions of the C code in this library are copyright (c) 1994 by the
  Regents of the University of California.  All rights reserved.  The
  license on this code is compatible with the licensing of the rest of
  the distribution - please see the source code in F<Cwd.xs> for the
  details.
 .
 but, as discussed in
  http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=64116
 this is outdated and dist/PathTools/Cwd.xs itself contains the correct
 information.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
 Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
 The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
 control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
 Package available as open source and free software.
 .
 You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
 license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
 terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
 make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
 a different licensing arrangement.
 .
 Definitions
 .
 "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
 the copyright notice for the entire Package.
 .
 "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
 material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
 procedures.
 .
 "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,
 or modify the Package.
 .
 "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
 Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A
 given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a
 Modified Version.
 .
 "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
 accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
 organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
 .
 "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
 Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It
 does not mean licensing fees.
 .
 "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,
 or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the
 Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
 changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
 Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may
 be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
 .
 "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
 configuration files for the Package.
 .
 "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or
 any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation
 of the Source form.
 .
 Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
 .
 (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
 Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
 you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
 .
 Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
 .
 (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
 either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
 all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At
 your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
 Compiled form of the Package.
 .
 (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
 modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting
 Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
 will be subject to the Original License.
 .
 Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 .
 (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
 or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
 Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
 from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
 any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
 you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
 (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
 Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
 Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b)
 ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
 user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the
 Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of
 the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the
 Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version
 available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license
 that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the
 Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy
 that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the
 Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
 available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are
 allowed.
 .
 Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
 Versions without the Source
 .
 (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
 the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
 get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be
 valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any
 time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
 must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
 If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
 days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
 you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 .
 (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
 Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
 Source of the Modified Version.
 .
 Aggregating or Linking the Package
 .
 (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
 Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
 aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
 Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
 components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
 apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
 as included in the aggregation.
 .
 (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
 other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
 build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
 include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
 provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
 .
 Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

 (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE

License:  CC0-1.0
 Statatement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
 of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work
 for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
 other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
 whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
 purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal
 of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and
 scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
 their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that
 he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
 voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute
 the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
 Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect
 of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright
 and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are
 not limited to, the following:
 .
    the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
    communicate, and translate a Work;
 .
    moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
    publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
    likeness depicted in a Work;
 .
    rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
    subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
    rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
 .
    database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC
    of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996
    on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
    implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version
    of such directive); and
 .
    other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
    thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all
 of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and
 causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing
 as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in
 all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
 applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the
 Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
 detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
 Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
 termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the
 quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's
 express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
 then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted
 taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In
 addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby
 grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
 sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license
 to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)
 in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided
 by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall
 be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
 Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
 invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity
 or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
 and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
 exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
 with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
 Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
    No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
    abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
    document.
 .
    Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties
    of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
    or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,
    all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
    Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
    persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
    without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
    Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
    necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any
    use of the Work.
 .
    Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not
    a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect
    to this CC0 or use of the Work.

Comment:
 ----------------------------------------
 The first two alternative licenses, as retrieved at
  Thu, 09 May 2013 00:00:38 +0300
 are included at the end of this file.
 .
 Part of this file carries the following comment:
 .
  FYI: This is the "Super-Fast" algorithm mentioned by Bob Jenkins in
  (http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html)
  It is by Paul Hsieh (c) 2004 and is analysed here
  http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/hash.html
  license terms are here:
  http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/weblicense.html
 .
 As of Thu, 09 May 2013 00:02:53 +0300, the "weblicense.html" document
 states:
 .
  Unless otherwise accompanied by another included license, the text
  and explicitly rendered exposition of all content under this website
  is covered by the Paul Hsieh exposition license.
 .
  For the specific coverage of raw source code (only) obtained from
  this website, you have the option of using the old-style BSD license
  to use the code instead of other the licenses. This option has been
  provided for people who can't figure out what I talking about with my
  derivative license, or who are using a old-style BSD compatible license.
 .
  Unless otherwise accompanied by another included license, derivative
  work by taking portions or ideas from the above mentioned exposition
  are covered by the Paul Hsieh derivative license.
 .
  Examples: Unless covered by another accompanying license, source code
  shown on my website can be used freely under the derivative license,
  (and may be distributed under a public domain license, whether compiled
  into another program or not, for example) however the font, comments,
  colors or any layout details associated to that source code in its
  exposition are covered by the exposition license.
 .
  The entire English text describing the code is also covered under the
  exposition license and thus cannot be copied at all outside the limits
  of fair use.
 .
  Images and graphics shown on this website are entirely covered by the
  exposition license.
 .
  If a proprietary vendor wishes to create a closed source object code
  based product using source covered by the derivative license they may
  do so. However if this vendor then wished to distribute the original
  source code, they may not apply any licensing terms which contradict
  the original derivative license covering the derivative code.
 .
  If your code is compatible with the old style BSD license and you
  wish to avoid the burden of explicitely protecting code you obtained
  from here from misrepresentation then you can simply cover it with
  the old-style BSD license.
 .
 It is therefore assumed that the relevant part of the Perl source
 is licensed under either the "Paul Hsieh derivative license" or
 the "the old-style BSD license", which have been included at
 the end of file with the codenames HSIEH-DERIVATIVE and HSIEH-BSD.
 .
 Additionally, the "hash.html" document has this statement for the
 relevant source code:
 .
  IMPORTANT NOTE: Since there has been a lot of interest for the code
  below, I have decided to additionally provide it under the LGPL 2.1
  license. This provision applies to the code below only and not to any
  other code including other source archives or listings from this site
  unless otherwise specified.
 .
  The LGPL 2.1 is not necessarily a more liberal license than my
  derivative license, but this additional licensing makes the code
  available to more developers. Note that this does not give you
  multi-licensing rights. You can only use the code under one of the
  licenses at a time.
 .

Comment:
 ----------------------------------------
 The main license applies to most of the code:
 .
  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the same terms as Perl itself.
 .
 but portions of it have been taken from a BSD variant and are licensed
 under the terms of the "BSD-3-clause-GENERIC" license included in this file.
 .
 dist/PathTools/Cwd.pm states:
 .
  Portions of the C code in this library are copyright (c) 1994 by the
  Regents of the University of California.  All rights reserved.  The
  license on this code is compatible with the licensing of the rest of
  the distribution - please see the source code in F<Cwd.xs> for the
  details.
 .
 but, as discussed in
  http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=64116
 this is outdated and dist/PathTools/Cwd.xs itself contains the correct
 information.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
 Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
 The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
 control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
 Package available as open source and free software.
 .
 You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
 license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
 terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
 make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
 a different licensing arrangement.
 .
 Definitions
 .
 "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
 the copyright notice for the entire Package.
 .
 "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
 material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
 procedures.
 .
 "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,
 or modify the Package.
 .
 "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
 Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A
 given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a
 Modified Version.
 .
 "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
 accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
 organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
 .
 "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
 Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It
 does not mean licensing fees.
 .
 "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,
 or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the
 Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
 changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
 Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may
 be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
 .
 "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
 configuration files for the Package.
 .
 "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or
 any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation
 of the Source form.
 .
 Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
 .
 (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
 Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
 you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
 .
 Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
 .
 (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
 either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
 all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At
 your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
 Compiled form of the Package.
 .
 (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
 modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting
 Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
 will be subject to the Original License.
 .
 Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 .
 (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
 or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
 Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
 from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
 any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
 you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
 (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
 Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
 Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b)
 ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
 user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the
 Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of
 the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the
 Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version
 available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license
 that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the
 Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy
 that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the
 Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
 available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are
 allowed.
 .
 Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
 Versions without the Source
 .
 (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
 the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
 get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be
 valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any
 time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
 must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
 If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
 days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
 you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 .
 (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
 Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
 Source of the Modified Version.
 .
 Aggregating or Linking the Package
 .
 (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
 Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
 aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
 Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
 components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
 apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
 as included in the aggregation.
 .
 (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
 other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
 build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
 include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
 provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
 .
 Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
 .
 (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
 merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
 the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not
 considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
 terms of this license.
 .
 General Provisions
 .
 (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
 Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
 modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
 use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
 license.
 .
 (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version
 made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to
 ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
 this license.
 .
 (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
 service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
 .
 (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
 free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
 sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
 patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
 infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
 that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
 infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
 date that such litigation is filed.
 .
 (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT
 PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT
 HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
 INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
 OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

 (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
 OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

License:  CC0-1.0
 Statatement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
 of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work
 for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
 other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
 whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
 purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal
 of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and
 scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
 their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that
 he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
 voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute
 the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
 Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect
 of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright
 and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are
 not limited to, the following:
 .
    the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
    communicate, and translate a Work;
 .
    moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
    publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
    likeness depicted in a Work;
 .
    rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
    subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
    rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
 .
    database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC
    of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996
    on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
    implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version
    of such directive); and
 .
    other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
    thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all
 of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and
 causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing
 as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in
 all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
 applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the
 Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
 detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
 Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
 termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the
 quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's
 express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
 then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted
 taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In
 addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby
 grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
 sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license
 to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)
 in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided
 by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall
 be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
 Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
 invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity
 or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
 and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
 exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
 with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
 Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
    No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
    abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
    document.
 .
    Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties
    of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
    or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,
    all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
    Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
    persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
    without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
    Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
    necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any
    use of the Work.
 .
    Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not
    a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect
    to this CC0 or use of the Work.

 As of Thu, 09 May 2013 00:02:53 +0300, the "weblicense.html" document
 states:
 .
  Unless otherwise accompanied by another included license, the text
  and explicitly rendered exposition of all content under this website
  is covered by the Paul Hsieh exposition license.
 .
  For the specific coverage of raw source code (only) obtained from
  this website, you have the option of using the old-style BSD license
  to use the code instead of other the licenses. This option has been
  provided for people who can't figure out what I talking about with my
  derivative license, or who are using a old-style BSD compatible license.
 .
  Unless otherwise accompanied by another included license, derivative
  work by taking portions or ideas from the above mentioned exposition
  are covered by the Paul Hsieh derivative license.
 .
  Examples: Unless covered by another accompanying license, source code
  shown on my website can be used freely under the derivative license,
  (and may be distributed under a public domain license, whether compiled
  into another program or not, for example) however the font, comments,
  colors or any layout details associated to that source code in its
  exposition are covered by the exposition license.
 .
  The entire English text describing the code is also covered under the
  exposition license and thus cannot be copied at all outside the limits
  of fair use.
 .
  Images and graphics shown on this website are entirely covered by the
  exposition license.
 .
  If a proprietary vendor wishes to create a closed source object code
  based product using source covered by the derivative license they may
  do so. However if this vendor then wished to distribute the original
  source code, they may not apply any licensing terms which contradict
  the original derivative license covering the derivative code.
 .
  If your code is compatible with the old style BSD license and you
  wish to avoid the burden of explicitely protecting code you obtained
  from here from misrepresentation then you can simply cover it with
  the old-style BSD license.
 .
 It is therefore assumed that the relevant part of the Perl source
 is licensed under either the "Paul Hsieh derivative license" or
 the "the old-style BSD license", which have been included at
 the end of file with the codenames HSIEH-DERIVATIVE and HSIEH-BSD.
 .
 Additionally, the "hash.html" document has this statement for the
 relevant source code:
 .
  IMPORTANT NOTE: Since there has been a lot of interest for the code
  below, I have decided to additionally provide it under the LGPL 2.1
  license. This provision applies to the code below only and not to any
  other code including other source archives or listings from this site
  unless otherwise specified.
 .
  The LGPL 2.1 is not necessarily a more liberal license than my
  derivative license, but this additional licensing makes the code
  available to more developers. Note that this does not give you
  multi-licensing rights. You can only use the code under one of the
  licenses at a time.
 .

 ----------------------------------------
 The main license applies to most of the code:
 .
  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the same terms as Perl itself.
 .
 but portions of it have been taken from a BSD variant and are licensed
 under the terms of the "BSD-3-clause-GENERIC" license included in this file.
 .
 dist/PathTools/Cwd.pm states:
 .

 but, as discussed in

 this is outdated and dist/PathTools/Cwd.xs itself contains the correct

 Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
 Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
 The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
 control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
 Package available as open source and free software.
 .
 You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
 license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
 terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
 make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
 a different licensing arrangement.
 .
 Definitions
 .
 "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
 the copyright notice for the entire Package.
 .
 "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
 material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
 procedures.
 .
 "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,
 or modify the Package.
 .
 "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
 Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A
 given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a
 Modified Version.
 .
 "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
 accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
 organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
 .
 "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
 Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It
 does not mean licensing fees.
 .
 "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,
 or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the
 Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
 changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
 Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may
 be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
 .
 "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
 configuration files for the Package.
 .
 "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or
 any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation
 of the Source form.
 .
 Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
 .
 (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
 Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
 you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
 .
 Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
 .
 (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
 either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
 all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At
 your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
 Compiled form of the Package.
 .
 (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
 modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting
 Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
 will be subject to the Original License.
 .
 Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 .
 (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
 or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
 Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
 from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
 any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
 you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
 (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
 Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
 Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b)
 ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
 user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the
 Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of
 the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the
 Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version
 available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license
 that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the
 Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy
 that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the
 Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
 available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are
 allowed.
 .
 Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
 Versions without the Source
 .
 (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
 the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
 get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be
 valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any
 time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
 must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
 If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
 days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
 you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 .
 (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
 Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
 Source of the Modified Version.
 .
 Aggregating or Linking the Package
 .
 (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
 Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
 aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
 Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
 components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
 apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
 as included in the aggregation.
 .
 (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
 other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
 build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
 include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
 provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
 .
 Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
 .
 (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
 merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
 the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not
 considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
 terms of this license.
 .
 General Provisions
 .
 (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
 Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
 modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
 use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
 license.
 .
 (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version
 made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to
 ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
 this license.
 .
 (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
 service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
 .
 (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
 free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
 sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
 patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
 infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
 that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
 infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
 date that such litigation is filed.
 .
 (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT
 PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT
 HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
 INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
 OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

 (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
 OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

License:  CC0-1.0
 Statatement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
 of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work
 for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
 other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
 whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
 purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal
 of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and
 scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
 their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that
 he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
 voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute
 the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
 Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect
 of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright
 and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are
 not limited to, the following:
 .
    the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
    communicate, and translate a Work;
 .
    moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
    publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
    likeness depicted in a Work;
 .
    rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
    subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
    rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
 .
    database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC
    of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996
    on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
    implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version
    of such directive); and
 .
    other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
    thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all
 of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and
 causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing
 as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in
 all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
 applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the
 Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
 detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
 Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
 termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the
 quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's
 express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
 then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted
 taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In
 addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby
 grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
 sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license
 to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)
 in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided
 by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall
 be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
 Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
 invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity
 or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
 and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
 exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
 with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
 Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
    No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
    abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
    document.
 .
    Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties
    of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
    or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,
    all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
    Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
    persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
    without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
    Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
    necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any
    use of the Work.
 .
    Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not
    a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect
    to this CC0 or use of the Work.

python: 
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the Python programming
language. Python was written by Guido van Rossum <guido@cwi.nl> and others.

This package was put together by Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org> from
sources from ftp.python.org:/pub/python, based on the Debianization by
the previous maintainers Bernd S. Brentrup <bsb@uni-muenster.de> and
Bruce Perens.

Current maintainer is Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org> until the final
2.3 version is released.


Copyright notice (as found in LICENSE in the original source).
--------------------------------------------------------------

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

Note that the choice of GPL compatibility outlined above doesn't extend
to modules linked to particular libraries, since they change the
effective License of the module binary.


GNU Readline
------------

The 'readline' module makes use of GNU Readline.

      The GNU Readline Library is free software; you can redistribute it
      and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
      published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at
      your option) any later version.

      On Debian systems, you can find the complete statement in
      /usr/share/doc/readline-common/copyright'. A copy of the GNU General
      Public License is available in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.


OpenSSL
-------

The '_ssl' module makes use of OpenSSL.

      The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the
      conditions of the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license
      apply to the toolkit. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open
      Source licenses. Note that both licenses are incompatible with
      the GPL.

      On Debian systems, you can find the complete license text in
      /usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright'.

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

        version is still 5 times faster, though.

Licenses for Software linked to
===============================

Note that the choice of GPL compatibility outlined above doesn't extend
to modules linked to particular libraries, since they change the
effective License of the module binary.


GNU Readline
------------

The 'readline' module makes use of GNU Readline.

      The GNU Readline Library is free software; you can redistribute it
      and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
      published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at
      your option) any later version.

      On Debian systems, you can find the complete statement in
      /usr/share/doc/readline-common/copyright'. A copy of the GNU General
      Public License is available in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.


OpenSSL
-------

The '_ssl' module makes use of OpenSSL.

      The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the
      conditions of the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license
      apply to the toolkit. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open
      Source licenses. Note that both licenses are incompatible with
      the GPL.

      On Debian systems, you can find the complete license text in
      /usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright'.

python3: 
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the Python programming
language. Python was written by Guido van Rossum <guido@cwi.nl> and others.

This package was put together by Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org> from
sources from ftp.python.org:/pub/python, based on the Debianization by
the previous maintainers Bernd S. Brentrup <bsb@uni-muenster.de> and
Bruce Perens.

Current maintainer is Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org> until the final
2.3 version is released.


Copyright notice (as found in LICENSE in the original source).
--------------------------------------------------------------

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

python3-minimal: 
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the Python programming
language. Python was written by Guido van Rossum <guido@cwi.nl> and others.

This package was put together by Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org> from
sources from ftp.python.org:/pub/python, based on the Debianization by
the previous maintainers Bernd S. Brentrup <bsb@uni-muenster.de> and
Bruce Perens.

Current maintainer is Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org> until the final
2.3 version is released.


Copyright notice (as found in LICENSE in the original source).
--------------------------------------------------------------

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

      Modified by Jack Jansen, CWI, July 1995:
      - Use binascii module to do the actual line-by-line conversion
        between ascii and binary. This results in a 1000-fold speedup. The C
        version is still 5 times faster, though.
      - Arguments more compliant with python standard

Licenses for Software linked to
===============================

Note that the choice of GPL compatibility outlined above doesn't extend
to modules linked to particular libraries, since they change the
effective License of the module binary.


GNU Readline
------------

The 'readline' module makes use of GNU Readline.

      The GNU Readline Library is free software; you can redistribute it
      and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
      published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at
      your option) any later version.

      On Debian systems, you can find the complete statement in
      /usr/share/doc/readline-common/copyright'. A copy of the GNU General
      Public License is available in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.


OpenSSL
-------

The '_ssl' module makes use of OpenSSL.

      The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the
      conditions of the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license
      apply to the toolkit. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open
      Source licenses. Note that both licenses are incompatible with
      the GPL.

      On Debian systems, you can find the complete license text in
      /usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright'.

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

      Modified by Jack Jansen, CWI, July 1995:
      - Use binascii module to do the actual line-by-line conversion
        between ascii and binary. This results in a 1000-fold speedup. The C
        version is still 5 times faster, though.
      - Arguments more compliant with python standard

Licenses for Software linked to
===============================

Note that the choice of GPL compatibility outlined above doesn't extend
to modules linked to particular libraries, since they change the
effective License of the module binary.


GNU Readline
------------

The 'readline' module makes use of GNU Readline.

      The GNU Readline Library is free software; you can redistribute it
      and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
      published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at
      your option) any later version.

      On Debian systems, you can find the complete statement in
      /usr/share/doc/readline-common/copyright'. A copy of the GNU General
      Public License is available in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.


OpenSSL
-------

The '_ssl' module makes use of OpenSSL.

      The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the
      conditions of the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license
      apply to the toolkit. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open
      Source licenses. Note that both licenses are incompatible with
      the GPL.

      On Debian systems, you can find the complete license text in
      /usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright'.

rng-tools: 
This package was assembled by Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>,
based on previous work by Viral Shah <viral@debian.org>.

Upstream sources are at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/
  (module rng-tools)

The Debian packaging of rng-tools is:
  Copyright (c) 2003-2010 by Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>,
  Copyright (c) 2002 by Viral Shah <viral@debian.org>,
  and distributed under the same license as the upstream source it applies to.

Changes:
  The Debian version of rngd is extensively patched with added 
  functionality and bugs courtesy of Henrique de Moraes Holschuh.
  All changes were supposed to be proposed to be merged upstream, but the
  deviation got too large to handle, so it hasn't happened.  See upstream
  changelog for a list of all changes.

rpi-update: 


rsync: 
This is Debian's prepackaged version of Andrew Tridgell and
Paul Mackerras' rsync utility.

This package provides the rsync program, which is a replacement
for rcp that uses the rsync algorythm to transfer only the
differences between two sets of files.

This package was put together by Philip Hands <phil@hands.com>,
from sources obtained from:
  http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync-2.5.4.tar.gz
The current version was downloaded from:
  http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-3.1.0.tar.gz
on 2013-09-30 by Paul Slootman <paul@debian.org> .

The changes were very minimal - merely adding support for the Debian
package maintenance scheme by adding various debian/* files.
The only significant change is passing the -4 / -6 options through to ssh.
See the debian/patches/ directory.

Comment:
 The overall licence of the OpenSSH upstream code amounts to BSD-3-clause or
 various less restrictive licences, with the additional restrictions that
 derived versions must be clearly marked as such and that if derived works
 are incompatible with the RFC-specified protocol then they must be called
 by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".

sysvinit-utils: 
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of System V Init.

Init was written by Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>.

This package was first put together by Bruce Perens <Bruce@Pixar.com>
from pre-distribution sources. Ian Murdock <imurdock@debian.org>
integrated it into the base system maintained it until the end of 1995.
Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl> implemented Debian support.
In version 2.85 the package was split into three (sysvinit, sysv-rc,
and initscripts) in order to make room for alternative rc mechanisms.

The upstream source is available at:

Primary-Site:   ftp.cistron.nl /pub/people/miquels/software
                92K sysvinit-2.86.tar.gz
Alternate-Site: sunsite.unc.edu /pub/Linux/system/daemons/init
                92K sysvinit-2.86.tar.gz

Send patches to sysvinit-devel@nongnu.org.

The sysvinit package in Debian is maintained as an alioth project.
The project page is http://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-sysvinit/.

tar: 
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of GNU tar.  GNU
tar, heavily based on John Gilmore's public domain version of tar,
was originally written by Graham Todd.  It is now maintained by
Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com>.

This package is maintained for Debian by Bdale Garbee <bdale@gag.com>, and
was built from the sources found at:

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tar/

More recently, I'm directly using the upstream source repository at 

	http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/tar.git

unzip: 
This is the Debian prepackaged version of "unzip", Info-Zip's fast,
portable, zipfile decompression utility.

This package is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>
and built from sources obtained from:

ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/src/unzip60.tgz

The changes were fairly minimal, and consisted solely of adding
various debian/* files to the distribution, plus several miscellaneous
fixes as reflected in the Debian changelog.

Copyright and license:

This is version 2009-Jan-02 of the Info-ZIP license.
The definitive version of this document should be available at
ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/license.html indefinitely and
a copy at http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/license.html.


Copyright (c) 1990-2009 Info-ZIP.  All rights reserved.

For the purposes of this copyright and license, "Info-ZIP" is defined as
the following set of individuals:

   Mark Adler, John Bush, Karl Davis, Harald Denker, Jean-Michel Dubois,
   Jean-loup Gailly, Hunter Goatley, Ed Gordon, Ian Gorman, Chris Herborth,
   Dirk Haase, Greg Hartwig, Robert Heath, Jonathan Hudson, Paul Kienitz,
   David Kirschbaum, Johnny Lee, Onno van der Linden, Igor Mandrichenko,
   Steve P. Miller, Sergio Monesi, Keith Owens, George Petrov, Greg Roelofs,
   Kai Uwe Rommel, Steve Salisbury, Dave Smith, Steven M. Schweda,
   Christian Spieler, Cosmin Truta, Antoine Verheijen, Paul von Behren,
   Rich Wales, Mike White.

This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express
or implied.  In no event shall Info-ZIP or its contributors be held liable
for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages
arising out of the use of or inability to use this software.

Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
freely, subject to the above disclaimer and the following restrictions:

    1. Redistributions of source code (in whole or in part) must retain
       the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this list
       of conditions.

    2. Redistributions in binary form (compiled executables and libraries)
       must reproduce the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer,
       and this list of conditions in documentation and/or other materials
       provided with the distribution.  Additional documentation is not needed
       for executables where a command line license option provides these and
       a note regarding this option is in the executable's startup banner.  The
       sole exception to this condition is redistribution of a standard
       UnZipSFX binary (including SFXWiz) as part of a self-extracting archive;
       that is permitted without inclusion of this license, as long as the
       normal SFX banner has not been removed from the binary or disabled.

    3. Altered versions--including, but not limited to, ports to new operating
       systems, existing ports with new graphical interfaces, versions with
       modified or added functionality, and dynamic, shared, or static library
       versions not from Info-ZIP--must be plainly marked as such and must not
       be misrepresented as being the original source or, if binaries,
       compiled from the original source.  Such altered versions also must not
       be misrepresented as being Info-ZIP releases--including, but not
       limited to, labeling of the altered versions with the names "Info-ZIP"
       (or any variation thereof, including, but not limited to, different
       capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip," "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the
       explicit permission of Info-ZIP.  Such altered versions are further
       prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP
       e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP
       will provide support for the altered versions.

    4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
       "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its
       own source and binary releases.

    must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.

    (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts

    This implementation is based on Arai, Agui, and Nakajima's algorithm for
    scaled DCT.  Their original paper (Trans. IEICE E-71(11):1095) is in
    Japanese, but the algorithm is described in the Pennebaker & Mitchell
    JPEG textbook (see REFERENCES section in file README).  The following code
    is based directly on figure 4-8 in P&M.

xxd: 
This is the Debian pre-packaged version of vim.  Vim is an almost compatible
version of the UNIX editor Vi.  Many new features have been added: multi level
undo, syntax highlighting, command line history, on-line help, filename
completion, block operations, etc.

This package was put together by Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org> from
sources obtained from: ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unix/. The current maintainer
is Debian VIM Maintainers <pkg-vim-maintainers@lists.alioth.debian.org>.

Vim was written by Bram Moolenaar.  The following copying conditions are taken
from the online documentation.


I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
    that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute
    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must
    include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables
    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
    examples and Vim scripts.

II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four
    conditions are met:
    1) This license text must be included unmodified.
    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
	  the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you
	  (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
	  must make your changes, including source code, available to the
	  maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
	  include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the
	  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
	  will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation
	  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.
	  The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>.  If this
	  changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
	  vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely
	  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
	  your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
	  received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
	  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
	  unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the
	  text under a) applies to those changes.
       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
	  the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a
	  context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you
	  add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
	  making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
	  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
	  changes if the following three conditions are met:
	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
	    version of Vim without fee or restriction.
	  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
	    distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer
	    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
	    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
	    available to him.
	  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This
	    contact information must remain valid for at least three years
	    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long
	    as possible.
       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
	  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
	  any later version.
    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"
       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
       is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned
       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
       not conflict with the license used for the changes.
    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
       corrections.

III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
     the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is
     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.
     If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
     context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is
     <maintainer@vim.org>

IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim
     sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this
     license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came
     with, at your option.

On Debian systems the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 is located on
the filesystem at /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2.

The Vim user manual and reference manual are Copyright (c) 1988-2003 by Bram
Moolenaar and are distributed under the Open Publication License, v1.0 or later
(no license options are exercised):


Open Publication License
v1.0, 8 June 1999


I. REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS

The Open Publication works may be reproduced and distributed in whole or in
part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the terms of this
license are adhered to, and that this license or an incorporation of it by
reference (with any options elected by the author(s) and/or publisher) is
displayed in the reproduction.

Proper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows:

    Copyright (c) <year> by <author's name or designee>. This material may be
    distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Open
    Publication License, vX.Y or later (the latest version is presently
    available at http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/).

The reference must be immediately followed with any options elected by the
author(s) and/or publisher of the document (see section VI).

Commercial redistribution of Open Publication-licensed material is permitted.

Any publication in standard (paper) book form shall require the citation of the
original publisher and author. The publisher and author's names shall appear on
all outer surfaces of the book. On all outer surfaces of the book the original
publisher's name shall be as large as the title of the work and cited as
possessive with respect to the title.


II. COPYRIGHT

The copyright to each Open Publication is owned by its author(s) or designee.


III. SCOPE OF LICENSE

The following license terms apply to all Open Publication works, unless
otherwise explicitly stated in the document.

Mere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open Publication
work with other works or programs on the same media shall not cause this
license to apply to those other works. The aggregate work shall contain a
notice specifying the inclusion of the Open Publication material and
appropriate copyright notice.

SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license remain in force.

NO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided "as is" without
warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or a
warranty of non-infringement.


IV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS

All modified versions of documents covered by this license, including
translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must meet the
following requirements:

   1. The modified version must be labeled as such.
   2. The person making the modifications must be identified and the
      modifications dated.
   3. Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if applicable must
      be retained according to normal academic citation practices.
   4. The location of the original unmodified document must be identified.
   5. The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to assert or
      imply endorsement of the resulting document without the original author's
      (or authors') permission.


V. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS

In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from and
strongly recommended of redistributors that:

   1. If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or CD-ROM, you
      provide email notification to the authors of your intent to redistribute
      at least thirty days before your manuscript or media freeze, to give the
      authors time to provide updated documents. This notification should
      describe modifications, if any, made to the document.
   2. All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either clearly
      marked up in the document or else described in an attachment to the
      document.
   3. Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered
      good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM expression of
      an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s).


VI. LICENSE OPTIONS

The author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed document may
elect certain options by appending language to the reference to or copy of the
license. These options are considered part of the license instance and must be
included with the license (or its incorporation by reference) in derived works.

A. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions without the
explicit permission of the author(s). "Substantive modification" is defined as
a change to the semantic content of the document, and excludes mere changes in
format or typographical corrections.

To accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of substantively modified
versions of this document is prohibited without the explicit permission of the
copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.

B. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in whole or in
part in standard (paper) book form for commercial purposes is prohibited unless
prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.

To accomplish this, add the phrase 'Distribution of the work or derivative of
the work in any standard (paper) book form is prohibited unless prior
permission is obtained from the copyright holder.' to the license reference or
copy.

Format: http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/
Upstream-Name: XZ Utils
Upstream-Contact:
 Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
 http://tukaani.org/xz/lists.html
Source:
 http://tukaani.org/xz
 http://git.tukaani.org/xz.git
Comment:
 XZ Utils is developed and maintained upstream by Lasse Collin.  Major
 portions are based on code by other authors; see AUTHORS for details.
 Most of the source has been put into the public domain, but some files
 have not (details below).
 .
 This file describes the source package.  The binary packages contain
 some files derived from other works: for example, images in the API
 documentation come from Doxygen.
License:
 Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here
 is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this
 package (but check the individual files to be sure!):
 .
   - liblzma is in the public domain.
 .
   - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public
     domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked
     in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under
     GNU LGPLv2.1+.
 .
   - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been
     adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are
     under GNU GPLv2+.
 .
   - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the
     XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories
     are in the public domain.
 .
   - Translated messages are in the public domain.
 .
   - The build system contains public domain files, and files that
     are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up
     in the binaries being built.
 .
   - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging
     utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.
 .
   - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files
     that are under various free software licenses.
 .
 You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into
 the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,
 take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find
 the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many
 lawyers.
 .
 As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.
 .
 If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils
 into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is
 polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but
 naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good
 notice to put into "about box" or into documentation:
 .
     This software includes code from XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>.
 .
 The following license texts are included in the following files:
   - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
   - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2
   - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3
 .
 Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code
 pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma
 binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety
 even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source
 package.
 .
 If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more
 information.

  COPYING says that most docs are in the public domain. Maybe that's not
  clear enough, but on the other hand it looks a bit stupid to put
  copyright information in tiny and relatively small docs like README.
 .
  I don't dare to say that _all_ XZ Utils specific docs are in the public
  domain unless otherwise mentioned in the file. I'm including PDF files
  generated by groff + ps2pdf, and some day I might include Doxygen-
  generated HTML docs too. Those don't include any copyright notices, but
  it seems likely that groff + ps2pdf or at least Doxygen put some
  copyrighted content into the generated files.

Comment:
 changelog.gz (commit 975d8fd) explains:
 .
 Recreated the BCJ test files for x86 and SPARC. The old files
 were linked with crt*.o, which are copyrighted, and thus the
 old test files were not in the public domain as a whole. They
 are freely distributable though, but it is better to be careful
 and avoid including any copyrighted pieces in the test files.
 The new files are just compiled and assembled object files,
 and thus don't contain any copyrighted code.

zip: 
This is the Debian prepackaged version of "zip", Info-Zip's fast, portable,
zipfile compression utility.

This package is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>
and built from sources obtained from:

ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/src/zip30.tgz

The changes were fairly minimal, and consisted solely of adding
various debian/* files to the distribution.

       e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP
       will provide support for the altered versions.

    4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
       "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its
